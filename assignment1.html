        <p>COMPUTER NETWORK is a digital telecommunication network which allows nodes to share resources.In computer networks<br>
        computer devices exchanges data with each other using connections (data links) between nodes.Network computer devices <br>
    that originates, routes nd terminate the data are called network nodes. </P><br>

    <P>computer network support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the world wide web, digital video,<br>
    digital audio, and share use of application and strorage servers,printers and fax machines and use of email and instant messaging applictions<br>
as well s many others. Computer networks differ in the trnsmission medium used to carry thier signals, communications protocols to<br>
carry thier signals.</P>
    <h3>Under this topic we are going to be discussing some sub headings such as:</h3>
    <ul> <li> NETWORK TOPOLOGY </li> <li> TYPES OF NETWORK</li> <li> SECURITY</li> <li> NETWORK SERVICE</li>
    </ul>
   <P> <h4>NETWORK TOPOLOGY:</h4> The physicl layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrms that describes<br>
a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographical. So therefore, Network topology is the layout or organisational hierachy of interconnected nodes <br>
of a computer network. different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliablity is often more critical.</P>
<h5> TYPES OF NETWORK TOPOLOGY</h5>
<ul>
    <li> BUS NETWORK</li>
    <LI>STAR NETWORK</LI>
    <li>RING NETWORK</li>
    <li>MESH NETWORK</li>
    <li>TREE NETWORK</li>
    <li> OVERLAY NETWORK</li>
